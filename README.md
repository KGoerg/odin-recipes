# odin-recipes
HTML project for The Odin Project

In this project, I will be building a recipes website consisting of a main index page, which then links to a few recipes. I will practice adding absolute links to the website my recipes come from, and relative links to other pages within my site. I will demonstrate my knowledge of adding both ordered and unordered lists to a web page. I will also demonstrate my ability to add images to a web page, as well as their required attributes.
