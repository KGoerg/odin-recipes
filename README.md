# odin-recipes
HTML project for The Odin Project

In this project, I will be building a recipes website consisting of a main index page, which then links to a few recipes. I will practice adding absolute links to the website my recipes come from, and relative links to other pages within my site. I will demonstrate my knowledge of adding both ordered and unordered lists to a web page. I will also demonstrate my ability to add images to a web page, as well as their required attributes.

Self-Reflection:

I tried to make my code legible and lay it out in a way that would make sense to other developers. I'm not sure if I should organize or nest things differently, and would love some feedback on that.

I am really, really proud of myself for completing this project. It feels amazing to create a small website from just a few blank .html files. I have the HTML boilerplate memorized by this point, but I want to continue writing it manually for now rather than use the <!> shortcut to auto-fill it. For this project, I only had to reference previous lessons twice, and that was because I knew I was forgetting something but couldn't remember what (how to lay out the href attribute and include text so that the text is the link was one; what the attribute is for noopener noreferrer -- =rel-- was another). 

I think this project is what finally made me understand how to commit files correctly. I kept running into an issue where entire folders were being committed with the same notes across all files. I figured out what I was doing wrong and now each file has its own notes, which makes a ton more sense! I was also pushing after every single commit before this project, which isn't necessarily wrong, but it's time-consuming! I learned to trust myself and Git to keep record of all my commits and push everything all at once.
