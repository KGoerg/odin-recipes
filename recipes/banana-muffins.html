    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe makes 5 - 6 fairly large banana muffins, depending on how big your baking tin is. I personally love this recipe because of how easy it is to follow, and it has very simple ingredients. While the recipe may be basic, the muffins themselves are not!</p>

            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         </ul>
