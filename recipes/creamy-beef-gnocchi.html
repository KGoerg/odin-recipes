    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a slight alteration of <a href="https://cookinginthemidwest.com/blog/creamybeefgnocchi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooking in the Midwest's</a> "Creamy Beef and Gnocchi" recipe. I've changed a couple of things, otherwise this is practically the same recipe. Give him a shout out!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 1/2 TBSP of dehydrated minced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp each of paprika and italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 TBSP of minced garlic. I tend to use the dehydrated stuff</li>
        <li>1 handful of spinach leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>2 packs of gnocchi</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook ground beef and minced onion over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drain a majority of the grease. I find leaving some helps keep the ground beef juicy and flavorful.</li>
        <li>Season meat with salt, pepper, paprika, and italian seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic, spinach leaves, beef broth, heavy cream, parmesan cheese, and gnocchi.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil and lower heat to medium-low. Cover and let cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the lid, stir well, and cook for a few more minutes or until gnocchi is cooked through. Depending on how cooked the gnocchi is, you may want to cover and let simmer for a few more minutes instead.</li>
        <li>Serve and top with more parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
