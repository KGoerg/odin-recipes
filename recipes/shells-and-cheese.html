    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my all-time favorite shells and cheese recipe. Whenever I'm asked to bring something for Thanksgiving, this is it! The recipe is easy to follow, and it's fun to change up some of the spices and cheeses to switch things up!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 full box large shells pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Lawry's Seasoned Salt</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cheese (I personally enjoy 2 cups of cheddar, 1 cup of parmesan, and 1 cup of colby jack)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a pot of water. Add a generous sprinkling of salt for the pasta.</li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a pot large enough to hold the pasta when it's done.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and stir over medium heat until the mixture is lightly browned. This usually takes 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Slowly add in the milk, whisking to remove any lumps.</li>
            <li>Add the salt, pepper, and Lawry's Seasoned Salt.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium-high heat until the sauce thickens and starts to bubble. Make sure to stir the sauce the entire time to ensure it stays smooth.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the cheese and whisk until smooth. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done, drain it and add to the pot with the sauce. Stir until well combined, then serve.</li>
        </ol>
