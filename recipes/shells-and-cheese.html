    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my all-time favorite shells and cheese recipe. Whenever I'm asked to bring something for Thanksgiving, this is it! The recipe is easy to follow, and it's fun to change up some of the spices and cheeses to switch things up!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 full box large shells pasta</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons salted butter</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt
            <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Lawry's Seasoned Salt</li>
            <li>4 cups shredded cheese (I personally enjoy 2 cups of cheddar, 1 cup of parmesan, and 1 cup of colby jack)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
